# Analytics Portfolio

This repository collects portfolio-ready case studies that showcase product analytics, conversion rate optimization, and lifecycle analysis skills.

## TL;DR
- Clone the repo and open a case study folder to explore the business context, dataset, and analysis assets.  
- Install required Python libraries (e.g. `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) to reproduce results.
