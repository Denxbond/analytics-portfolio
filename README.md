# Product Analytics Portfolio Cases

This portfolio showcases my ability to apply product analytics, experimentation, and business modeling to drive growth, retention, and strategic decision-making.
Each case study represents analytical frameworks I’ve used in real-world environments.

## TL;DR
- Explore each case folder for business context, dataset, and analysis outputs.
- Install standard Python dependencies (e.g., `pandas`, `matplotlib`) to reproduce metrics locally.
- SQL models illustrate how key metrics could be materialized in a data warehouse or dbt project using anonymized data.

## Projects
- [Funnel Optimization Case Study](funnel_optimization_case/README.md):
  Reg→Dep funnel analysis with SQL, Python, and an experiment playbook.
- [Retention Cohort Dashboard](retention_cohort_dashboard/README.md):
  Weekly cohort retention heatmap built from synthetic lifecycle events.
- [A/B Test Simulator](ab_test_simulator/README.md):
  Controlled experiment simulation with lift, p-value, and power reporting.
- [User Journey Path Analysis](user_journey_path_analysis/README.md):
  Behavioural path aggregation and journey visualization from clickstream data.
- [Revenue Forecast Model](revenue_forecast_model/README.md):
  Forecasts next-quarter revenue via exponential smoothing using simulated deposit and churn data.
- [Bonus Offer Impact Analysis](bonus-offer-impact-analysis):
  Evaluates how a promotional bonus affects deposit frequency and ARPU using simulated user data.

## Disclaimer
All projects are inspired by analytical challenges I’ve solved professionally, but no proprietary data, logic, or business context is included.
All datasets are synthetic and anonymized, created solely for demonstration.
Any resemblance to real products, metrics, or organizations is purely coincidental.
