# Product Analytics Portfolio Cases

This portfolio showcases my ability to apply product analytics, experimentation, and business modeling to drive growth, retention, and strategic decision-making.  
Each case study represents analytical frameworks I’ve used in real-world environments.

- Explore each case folder for business context, dataset, and analysis outputs.
- Install standard Python dependencies (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`) to reproduce metrics locally.
- SQL models illustrate how key metrics could be materialized in a data warehouse or dbt project using anonymized data.

## Projects

- [Business Review Dashboard](business_review_dashboard/README.md):  
  Aggregates core KPIs (NSM, ARPU, retention, churn) into a quarterly business health overview with insights narrative.

## Disclaimer
All projects are inspired by analytical challenges I’ve solved professionally, but no proprietary data, logic, or business context is included.  
All datasets are synthetic and anonymized, created solely for demonstration.  
Any resemblance to real products, metrics, or organizations is purely coincidental.
