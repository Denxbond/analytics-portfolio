analytics, conversion rate optimization, and analytics engineering skills.

## TL;DR
- Clone the repo and open a case study folder to see the business story,
  dataset, and analysis assets.
- Install any listed Python dependencies (e.g., `pandas`) and run the provided
  scripts to reproduce the metrics.
- Use the SQL models to materialize metrics in your own warehouse or dbt
  project, swapping in anonymized production data when sharing publicly.

## Projects

## Getting Started
Each project includes synthetic data, reproducible code, and documentation.
Clone the repo, explore the folders, and adapt the templates with anonymized
metrics from your own work. Each README includes exact run commands so you can
verify the analysis locally before publishing your own numbers.
