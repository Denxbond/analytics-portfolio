# Growth Strategy Playbook – Scalable B2C Product Case Study

## 1. Objective and Context
- **Product vision:** Deliver a seamless digital experience that maximizes user activation, repeat engagement, and long-term revenue sustainability.  
- **Current state:** Strong initial acquisition through promotional channels, but drop-off after first engagement and stagnating contribution margin.  
- **Strategic objective:** Achieve sustainable double-digit monthly active-user growth while moving the business toward positive unit economics within 12 months.

## 2. North Star Metric (NSM)
- **Metric:** Weekly Active Users completing ≥2 core actions *(e.g., transactions, rides, deposits, or conversions).*  
- **Rationale:**  
  - Captures both **activation** (first meaningful action) and **habit formation** (repeat within key cadence).  
  - Correlates with **liquidity**, **engagement**, and **monetization efficiency**.  
  - Balances **growth and quality** by filtering out one-time promo users and churn risks.

## 3. Growth Hypotheses

### Activation Levers
- Simplifying onboarding *(one-tap verification, clear value presentation)* will raise first-week conversion from **42% → 55%**.  
- Contextual incentives *(bundled offers or dynamic bonuses)* will boost first-to-second-action conversion by reducing price anxiety.

### Retention Levers
- Personalized recommendations and saved preferences will increase **Week-4 retention 32% → 40%**.  
- Transparent reliability signals *(status accuracy, reward clarity)* will reduce early drop-off by **15%**.

### Monetization Levers
- Tiered loyalty *(cashback or benefit unlocks after N actions)* will grow **ARPU +12%** without harming retention.  
- Smart batching or cross-sell recommendations will lift **margin +4 ppts** via higher transaction density.

## 4. Experiment Pipeline

1. **Opportunity Sizing** – Evaluate lift potential and user segments via historical cohorts; confirm sample size and guardrail thresholds.  
2. **Design & Instrumentation** – Define hypothesis, success metrics, and guardrails; ensure event logging with QA checklist.  
3. **Execution** – Run A/B or multivariate tests with sequential monitoring; track NSM, activation, and retention impact.  
4. **Readout & Decision**
   - **Primary metrics:** NSM delta, activation rate, Week-4 retention, contribution margin.  
   - **Guardrails:** Drop-off rate ≤ +2 ppts, operational latency ≤ +5%.  
   - **Decision framework:**  
     - ✅ Ship if NSM ≥ +3% with guardrails intact.  
     - ⚙️ Iterate if directional but inconclusive.  
     - ❌ Stop if negative NSM or guardrails breached.  
5. **Rollout & Scaling** – Gradual segment rollout with post-launch monitoring and seasonal backtesting.

## 5. ROTI Prioritization & Learning Loop

### ROTI Scoring (Reach, Outcome, Time, Investment)
- Score initiatives **1–5** per dimension; prioritize highest weighted ROTI:  
  - Reach **30%**, Outcome **40%**, Time **15%**, Investment **15%**.  
- **Example:**  
  - Loyalty tiering *(R=4, O=5, T=3, I=3 → Score 4.1)*  
  - Onboarding simplification *(R=5, O=3, T=4, I=4 → Score 3.8)*  
  - → Loyalty outranks onboarding.

### Learning Feedback Loop
- Centralize **experiment briefs**, **results**, and **ROTI scores** in a shared growth backlog.  
- Run **monthly Growth Reviews** to recycle insights:  
  - Failed tests → refined hypotheses.  
  - Passed tests → standardized playbook.  
- Maintain **rolling NSM forecast** to validate cumulative impact and recalibrate resource allocation.
