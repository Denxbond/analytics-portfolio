 Conversion Forecast After Bonus Campaign

## Project Overview
This project evaluates the sustainability of conversion rate improvements following a limited-time bonus incentive. By pairing synthetic historical data with exponential smoothing, the analysis helps campaign owners decide whether the uplift generated by the bonus will persist or require additional support.

## Contents
- `analysis/conversion_forecast_bonus.ipynb` — notebook walking through the modeling workflow.
- `data/synthetic_conversion_data.csv` — synthetic 60-day conversion history with campaign indicator.
- `reports/conversion_forecast_chart.png` — visualization comparing actual conversions against forecasted performance.

## Business Goal
Marketing teams frequently use bonuses or limited-time rewards to stimulate customer action. While these incentives often produce an immediate lift, understanding how much of that lift will remain once the promotion ends is critical for long-term planning. This project forecasts future conversion rates after the campaign to:

1. Estimate how quickly the conversion rate may normalize.
2. Quantify expected performance without continued incentives.
3. Support ROI calculations for follow-up marketing or retention activities.

## Analytical Approach
1. **Data Generation** — Create synthetic daily conversion rates for 40 days prior to the campaign and 20 days after launch, including a gradual decay in the uplift.
2. **Exponential Smoothing** — Fit a single-exponential smoothing model using `statsmodels` to project conversion rates two weeks beyond the observed window.
3. **Visualization** — Plot historical and forecasted conversion rates with the campaign launch date highlighted to illustrate the temporal impact.

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook in `analysis/` and run the cells to regenerate the model fit and visualization.
2. Adjust the smoothing parameters or forecast horizon to simulate different decay scenarios.
3. Reference the `reports/` chart when sharing insights with stakeholders.

## Skill Highlights
- Forecasting promotion-driven conversion trajectories.
- Evaluating campaign ROI durability.
- Communicating temporal impacts of marketing interventions.
