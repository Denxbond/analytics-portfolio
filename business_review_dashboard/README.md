# Synthetic Business Review Dashboard

## Purpose
This project provides an executive-ready dashboard built from synthetic marketplace metrics. It demonstrates how to translate daily data into business-ready insights and storyline charts that can be used in a quarterly business review.

## Business Context
A fictional marketplace is tracking four primary growth levers:

- **North Star Metric (NSM)** – Daily completed transactions across the platform.
- **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)** – Monetization performance of the active customer base.
- **Retention Rate** – Percentage of active customers who return the following day.
- **Churn Rate** – Percentage of active customers who fail to return within the next period.

Leadership wants to monitor how tactical initiatives influence these metrics over the course of the quarter. The dashboard highlights:

1. Daily trends for each KPI to uncover tactical wins or headwinds.
2. Relationships between monetization, retention, and churn to diagnose root causes.
3. A synthesized quarterly storyline that communicates whether the business is accelerating, stabilizing, or slowing.

Analysts can use the included dataset and Python visualization to present business review materials without exposing real data.
