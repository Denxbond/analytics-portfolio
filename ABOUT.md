I design experimentation systems that turn signal into compounding growth. My work blends CRO rigor with statistical guardrails so teams can ship confident decisions. I obsess over the connective tissue between user journeys and revenue systems, architecting scalable insights pipelines. Every project distills complex operations into actionable levers for product, marketing, and ops partners.
