# ABOUT

Iâ€™m a **Product and Growth Analyst** focused on conversion systems, experimentation, and behavioral analytics.  
I build systems that expose real user behavior, quantify friction, and convert signal into measurable growth.

My work connects **analytics, psychology, and UX** to understand not just what people do but why.  
Every click, scroll, and hesitation is a signal. I design frameworks that translate those signals into decisions that compound.

## Principles
- Data replaces opinion
- Structure beats chaos
- Discipline creates growth

This portfolio shows how I approach experimentation end-to-end: from defining metrics and testing hypotheses to turning insight into execution.  
All datasets are synthetic but built to reflect clean signal, no noise.
